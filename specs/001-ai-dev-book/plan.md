# Implementation Plan: AI-Driven Development Book

**Branch**: `001-ai-dev-book` | **Date**: 2025-11-30 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-ai-dev-book/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a Docusaurus-based book project for "AI-Driven Development". The project will focus on content creation, navigation, and portability, leveraging the Docusaurus platform.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES2021) / TypeScript
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, React
**Storage**: Markdown files (.mdx)
**Testing**: Jest
**Target Platform**: Web (Static Site)
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: Google Lighthouse score > 90; page loads in < 2s
**Constraints**: Must be deployable as a static site. All content must be in Markdown.
**Scale/Scope**: Approximately 100 pages, organized into chapters.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **I. Content First**: The plan prioritizes creating high-quality, well-structured content by using Docusaurus, which is designed for this purpose.
- [x] **II. Clear Navigation**: Docusaurus provides a side-bar for navigation and a table of contents, which will be configured.
- [x] **III. Platform Portability**: All content will be in Markdown files, ensuring portability.
- [x] **IV. Docusaurus-Powered**: The entire project is built on Docusaurus.
- [x] **V. Spec-Driven Development**: This plan is the output of the `/sp.plan` command, following the spec-driven workflow.
