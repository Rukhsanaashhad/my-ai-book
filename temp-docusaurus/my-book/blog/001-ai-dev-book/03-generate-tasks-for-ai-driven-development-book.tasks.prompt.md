## PROMPT

/sp.tasks

## RESPONSE

I have generated the tasks for the AI-Driven Development Book project.

- **Branch**: `001-ai-dev-book`
- **Tasks**: `specs/001-ai-dev-book/tasks.md`

The tasks are organized by user story and are ready for implementation. You can now proceed with `/sp.implement`.
