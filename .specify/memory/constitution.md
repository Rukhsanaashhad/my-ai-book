# Docusaurus Book Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Content First
The primary focus is on creating high-quality, well-structured content, organized into chapters and pages.

### II. Clear Navigation
The book must be easy to navigate, with a clear table of contents and intuitive navigation controls.

### III. Platform Portability
All content must be written in standard Markdown and be easily exportable, ensuring content is not locked to the platform.

### IV. Docusaurus-Powered
The project will be built using Docusaurus, leveraging its features for documentation websites.

### V. Spec-Driven Development
Development will follow the "Specify, Plan, Task" workflow, ensuring changes are deliberate and well-architected.

## Development Workflow

All changes will be managed through the Spec-Driven Development process. This includes creating specifications, implementation plans, and task breakdowns before writing code.

## Quality Assurance

Automated checks and manual reviews will be used to ensure content quality, structural integrity, and adherence to these principles.

## Governance

This constitution is the source of truth for project principles. Amendments require review and approval to ensure they align with the project's core goals. All project members are expected to adhere to these principles.
